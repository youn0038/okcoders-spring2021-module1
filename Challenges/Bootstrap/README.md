## Make a Header responsive through Bootstrap and CSS.
You will make a Header responsive primarily through using Bootstrap classes. Some custom CSS can be added. 

### Notes:

* header_smallScreen shows what the finished header looks like on a small screen (defined as less Bootstrap's small and xs sizes)
