# Challenge 2

## Make our class header responsive using only CSS
Take the starting code (this is the header we created in class) and transform and make it responsive for screen sizes less than 800px.
Use the images provided to inform your solution.

### Notes:
* problem-header_smallScreen shows the problem. This is what the header currently looks like on small screens.
* header_largeScreen is the starting image of the header and what it looks like on a large screen.
* finalOutput shows what your header should look like once made responsive for small screens (less than 800px)
